LONG TERM:
- Hierarchical GameObjects
- Make each GameObject's transform relative to their parent GameObject's transform
- Level management
- PNG support for transparency
- Tilemaps
- Audio handling
- Improved input handling
- Particle system
- Simple rigidbody physics
- Data saving / loading
- Text rendering
- Animation system
- Camera class, movable cameras etc.
- UI management (widgets and a method of describing them)
- OPTIMIZE EVERYTHING

SHORT TERM:
- Add tags to GameObjects
- Add rendering layers to sprites
DONE! 3. Allow shaders to be used on a per-sprite basis

TO FIX:
- If the same vertex/fragment shader is used with multiple shader programs they are compiled more than once
- Make GameObject names unique
